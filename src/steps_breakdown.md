## Work Coordination Strategy

### Dependencies to Manage
1. **Phase 1** must complete before **Phase 2** can begin
2. **Phase 2** must complete before **Phase 3** can begin
3. **Phase 4** can work in parallel with **Phase 3** (after repositories are done)
4. **Phase 5** depends on **Phase 3** completion
5. **Phase 6-7** can work in parallel once **Phase 5** is complete

### Communication Points
- **Daily standups** to coordinate interface changes
- **Weekly architecture reviews** to ensure consistency
- **Shared interface definitions** agreed upon before implementation
- **Database schema finalization** before any repository work begins

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit tests** for each service and repository
- **Integration tests** for API endpoints
- **End-to-end tests** for complete workflows
- **Performance tests** for reporting features

### Quality Gates
- **Code reviews** required for all pull requests
- **Test coverage** minimum 80% for new code
- **Documentation** required for all public interfaces
- **Performance benchmarks** for critical paths

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- [ ] All PRD requirements implemented
- [ ] Test coverage > 80%

- [ ] Zero critical security vulnerabilities

### Team Metrics
- [ ] Parallel development achieved with minimal conflicts
- [ ] All team members can work independently
- [ ] Clear ownership and responsibility areas
- [ ] Effective knowledge sharing and documentation

This breakdown allows 6-8 developers to work simultaneously while minimizing conflicts and ensuring proper system integration. Each workstream has clear deliverables and dependencies that can be tracked independently.
