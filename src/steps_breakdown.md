## Risk Management & Contingency Planning

### 🚨 Feature-Level Risk Mitigation

**Week 1 Risks:** Complex database migrations affecting existing data
- **Mitigation:** Incremental migrations with rollback procedures
- **Contingency:** Simplified book model if migration issues occur

**Week 2 Risks:** Member model complexity impacting performance
- **Mitigation:** Performance testing during development
- **Contingency:** Simplified member profile with optional advanced fields

**Week 3 Risks:** Business rules complexity causing development delays
- **Mitigation:** Implement core rules first, advanced rules later
- **Contingency:** Basic borrowing without complex validation initially

**Week 4 Risks:** Reporting queries impacting database performance
- **Mitigation:** Query optimization and caching strategies
- **Contingency:** Simplified reports with manual export options

**Week 5 Risks:** Performance optimization affecting stability
- **Mitigation:** Gradual optimization with comprehensive testing
- **Contingency:** Focus on deployment readiness over performance gains

This feature-based approach ensures that each week delivers tangible value to users while building toward the complete system. Each feature is a vertical slice through the entire architecture, providing immediate business value and reducing integration risks.
