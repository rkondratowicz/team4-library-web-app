### **Step 7: Update Book Borrowing with Member Integration**
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Priority:** High  
**Dependencies:** Steps 1, 2

#### Tasks:
- [x] ~~Modify copies table to include MemberID~~ (Not needed - using proper borrowings table)
- [x] Update existing borrowing system for member tracking (Already implemented)
- [x] Enforce member borrowing rules (Already implemented in previous steps)
- [x] Update book statistics to show member info

#### Implementation Details:
Instead of modifying the copies table, this step utilized the existing `borrowings` table which provides a better design for tracking member borrowing relationships. The implementation includes:

- **Member Borrowing Queries**: Added `getBookBorrowingDetails()` method to repository layer
- **Service Layer Integration**: Added service method to expose borrowing details to controllers
- **Admin View Enhancement**: Updated admin book table to display member information for borrowed books
- **UI Improvements**: Added "Borrowed By" column showing member names, emails, and due dates

#### Files Modified:
- Updated `src/repositories/SQLiteBookRepository.ts` - Added `getBookBorrowingDetails()` method
- Updated `src/services/BookService.ts` - Added service method for borrowing details
- Updated `src/controllers/MainController.ts` - Enhanced book data with borrowing details
- Updated `views/books/table.ejs` - Added "Borrowed By" column with member information and styling

#### Database Architecture:
The system maintains a clean separation using the existing `borrowings` table which provides:
- Proper foreign key relationships between members, copies, and books
- Comprehensive borrowing history tracking
- Better data integrity than modifying the copies table directly

### **Step 8: Implement Role-Based Access Control**
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Priority:** High  
**Dependencies:** Step 1

#### Tasks:
- [x] Create middleware to protect admin routes
- [x] Add role-based redirects
- [x] Ensure members can only access member features
- [x] Add unauthorized access handling

#### Implementation Details:
Comprehensive role-based access control system has been implemented with dedicated middleware and proper route protection.

**Key Features Implemented:**
- **Admin-Only Route Protection**: All admin features (book table, add/edit books, book details) now require admin authentication
- **Dedicated Middleware Files**: Created separate `adminAuth.ts` and `memberAuth.ts` for clear separation of concerns
- **Return-To Functionality**: Users are redirected to their intended destination after login
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Proper 403 error pages with role-appropriate navigation
- **Flexible Access Control**: Multiple middleware options for different access scenarios

#### Files Created/Modified:
- **NEW** `src/middleware/adminAuth.ts` - Admin-only middleware with multiple protection levels
- **NEW** `src/middleware/memberAuth.ts` - Member authentication middleware with flexible options
- **Updated** `src/routes/mainRoutes.ts` - Applied admin protection to all admin routes
- **Updated** `src/controllers/AuthController.ts` - Added returnTo redirect functionality
- **Enhanced** existing middleware in `src/middleware/auth.ts` continues to work alongside new middleware

#### Security Implementation:
```typescript
// Admin Routes Protection
router.get('/table', adminOnly, mainController.getBooksTable);
router.get('/add-book', adminOnly, mainController.getAddBookForm);
router.get('/edit/:id', adminOnly, mainController.getEditBookForm);

// Member Routes Protection (already implemented)
router.use('/member', requireAuth, requireMember);
router.use('/members', requireAuth, requireAdmin);
```

#### Access Control Matrix:
- **Public Access**: Login, register pages
- **Admin Only**: Book table, add/edit books, member management, analytics
- **Member + Admin**: Member dashboard, book browsing, borrowing functionality
- **API Protection**: All admin API endpoints protected

#### User Experience:
- **Seamless Redirects**: Users directed to intended pages after login
- **Role-Appropriate Dashboards**: Admins → main menu, Members → member dashboard
- **Clear Error Messages**: Helpful feedback for unauthorized access attempts
- **Session Management**: Proper session handling with returnTo functionality

---

### **Step 9: Create Member Registration Workflow**
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Priority:** Low  
**Dependencies:** Steps 1, 2

#### Tasks:
- [x] Build self-registration process
- [x] Add email validation
- [x] Implement password requirements

#### Implementation Details:
Comprehensive member registration workflow has been implemented with enhanced validation, user experience improvements, and optional email integration.

**Key Features Implemented:**
- **Enhanced Client-Side Validation**: Real-time password strength meter, email format validation, and password confirmation matching
- **Comprehensive Server-Side Validation**: Robust email regex validation, name validation, and strict password requirements
- **Password Security**: 8+ character minimum with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters required
- **User Experience**: Visual feedback indicators, strength meter, and clear error messaging
- **Email Integration**: Optional welcome email service with mock implementation ready for production integration

#### Files Created/Modified:
- **Enhanced** `views/auth/register.ejs` - Comprehensive registration form with real-time validation, password strength indicator, and improved UI/UX
- **Updated** `src/controllers/AuthController.ts` - Added robust server-side validation for names, emails, and passwords with detailed error messages
- **NEW** `src/services/EmailService.ts` - Welcome email service with HTML templates and mock implementation for production integration

#### Security Implementation:
```typescript
// Server-side validation includes:
- Name validation: /^[a-zA-Z\s]{2,}$/ (letters and spaces only, 2+ chars)
- Email validation: /^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$/
- Password requirements: 8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special chars
- Domain filtering: Blocks common test/temporary email domains
```

#### User Experience Features:
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Password strength meter with visual indicators
- **Progressive Validation**: Requirements turn green as they're met
- **Instant Email Validation**: Visual feedback for email format correctness
- **Password Matching**: Live confirmation validation with color-coded feedback
- **Loading States**: Button shows "Creating Account..." during submission
- **Enhanced Error Messages**: Specific, actionable error feedback

#### Email System Architecture:
```typescript
// EmailService supports:
- Welcome emails with HTML templates
- Password reset notifications (ready for implementation)
- Overdue book notifications (ready for implementation)
- Configuration management via environment variables
- Mock implementation for development, production-ready structure
```

#### Member Benefits Display:
The registration form prominently displays member benefits to encourage sign-ups:
- Browse complete book catalog
- Borrow up to 3 books at a time
- Track borrowed books and due dates
- One-click book returns
- Clean, user-friendly interface
